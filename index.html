    <h1> MethaneSAT </h1>
    <h2> ABOUT </h2>
    <p> MethaneSAT is a joint mission between the United States and New Zealand that is expected to launch in 2022.
      It will discover and measure methane emissions from oil and gas activities virtually anywhere on Earth,
      producing quantitative data that will allow corporations and nations to identify, control, and reduce their
      methane emissions, thereby lowering the rate at which our world is warming. MethaneSAT LLC is a wholly-owned
      subsidiary of the Environmental Defense Fund. The Environmental Defense Fund and the New Zealand Space Agency will
      operate it. </p>

          "> Shortwave infrared wavelengths, where methane absorbs light, will be measured by a spectrometer on
      MethaneSAT's spectrometer for high precision. Using this method, we can detect variations in methane
      concentrations of 2 parts per billion (ppb). MethaneSAT's small pixel size (1-2 km2) and wide view path (200
      km2) will be able to measure minor emission sources across huge areas that, in the aggregate, are important
      sources of methane emissions, but have been undetectable by satellites. The smaller the emission, the more
      precise the location can be determined with MethaneSAT's finer resolution data (although with less precision).

      <h2> CHALLENGES OF METHANESAT </h2>
      <p>Due to Earth's surface light reflection, measurements on methane concentration variations are severely
        constrained in terms of quantity and precision. Cloud cover, high latitudes in the winter, and dark surfaces all
        reduce the quantity of light that the satellite sensor can pick up on.</p>

              MethaneSAT's mission planning algorithms include a way to predict where clouds will be, so that when
